<h1>Crosby</h1>
<p>A Command Line Caching Layer</p>

<div class="group group-why">
  <h2>What is Crosby?</h2>
  <p>Crosby is a distributed command line caching layer. Are you tired of lengthy compilations or installations? Crosby checks if another Crosby user has done what you're attempting to do before and will write the results to your filesystem without actually running the command.</p>
</div>

<div class="group group-how">
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>Crosby looks for the result of the same command run against the same target. A target is defined as an identical file structure with identical contents in the current working directory that also has a matching operating system, CPU architecture, &amp; operating system.</p>
  <p>If a matching result is not found, Crosby runs the command normally and stores the result so that it will be available next time.</p>
